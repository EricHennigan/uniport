  Found out that the QTest library doesn't let me do event-driven testing
  because of issues regarding a qApp having been started (needed to support any
  event queue). Without that, cannot create a QTimer to replay recorded events.

  Will now do a redesign:
    Tick still be the time / price event
    TickStream class represents any source generating ticks
    Market subclasses TickStream, but holds a record of the latest seen ticks
           can act as a map from Stock->price
    Portfolio class currently implements a continuously rebalancing portfolio

    all prices are given in US dollars

  Current Testing plan:
    Mock the Market class to replay a recorded history of price changes, play
    these back in a loop. Then check that the portfolio rebalances properly.
